#+TITLE: DeepSky Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Brian O'Reilly

The emacs configuration used by most of the DeepSky crew. Repository
and code layout was originally taken from Daniel Mai's emacs
configuration published on github, into which a legacy emacs
configuration was merged. This is the result.

The configuration depends on Org mode. [[file:init.el][init.el]] sets up a few initial
GUI settings, bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], and loads [[file:config.org][config.org]], which is
where the majority of the configuration magic happens.
